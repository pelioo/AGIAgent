## 🚀 Project Introduction
**AGI Agent** is more than a platform for Vibe Colorful Doc, Vibe Coding, and natural-language task execution — it is an **interactive creation platform for rich documents and code**.

Through an intuitive GUI, AGI Agent collaborates with you on deep content refinement: swap images, edit text, tweak SVG graphics and Mermaid diagrams in real time, and even write-and-run HTML mini-apps with instant preview. Combined with natural language and a rich library of skills, it supports multi-round creative iteration, delivering a Cursor-like, highly interactive agent creation experience — both in the browser and in a pure Python environment.

The platform ships with 40+ built-in tools and supports GUI, CLI, and embedded modes. It can be deployed on the cloud, laptops, or embedded devices (ARM), with full compatibility for Anthropic/OpenAI API interfaces and open-source / self-hosted deployments.

**AGI Agent** follows a Plan based ReAct model for complicated task execution. It employs a multi-round iterative working mechanism where the large model can make tool calls and receive feedback results in each round. It is used to update files in the workspace or change the external environment through tools according to user needs. AGIAgent can autonomously call a wide range of MCP tools and operating system tools, featuring multi-agent collaboration, multi-level long-term memory, and embodied intelligence perception. It emphasizes the generality and autonomous decision-making capabilities of the agent. AGIAgent's extensive operating system support, large model support, and multiple operation modes make it suitable for building human-like general intelligence systems to achieve complex report research and generation, project-level code writing, automatic computer operation, multi-agent research (such as competition, debate, collaboration) and other applications.

### 📦 Easy Installation

Installation is straightforward. You can use `install.sh` for one-click installation. Basic functionality only requires Python 3.8+ environment. For document conversion and Mermaid image conversion, Playwright and LaTeX are needed. For basic features, you only need to configure the large model API. You don't need to configure an Embedding model, as the code includes built-in vectorized code retrieval functionality.

### Basic Usage

### GUI
```bash
python GUI/app.py

# Then access through browser at http://localhost:5001
```
Web GUI displays file lists. Folders with workspace subdirectories are listed by default, otherwise they won't be shown. The root directory location can be configured in config/config.txt.
Note: Web GUI is currently experimental, providing only a single-user development version (not suitable for industrial deployment).


#### CLI
```bash
#### New task
python agia.py "Write a joke" 
#### 📁 Specify Output Directory
python agia.py "Write a joke" --dir "my_dir"
#### 🔄 Continue Task Execution
python agia.py -c
#### ⚡ Set Execution Rounds
python agia.py --loops 5 -r "Requirement description"
#### 🔧 Custom Model Configuration
python agia.py --api-key YOUR_KEY --model gpt-4 --api-base https://api.openai.com/v1
```

> **Note**: 
1. Continue execution only restores the working directory and the last requirement prompt, not the large model's context.

2. Directly specify API configuration through command line, but it's recommended to configure in `config/config.txt` for reuse.

### 🛠️ External Skill File Support

The system supports external skill files (routines). The default skills are stored in the `routine` folder and will be displayed in the skill panel of the GUI (the `routine_zh` folder is shown in Chinese mode, and the `routine` folder is shown in English mode). You can also specify a custom skill directory:

```bash
#### 🧩 Use a custom skill directory
python agia.py "<your requirements>" --routine routine_file_dir
```

## ⚠️ Security Notice

As a general-purpose task agent, AGI Agent has the capability to call system terminal commands. Although it usually does not operate files outside the working directory, the large model may execute software installation commands (such as pip, apt, etc.). Please pay attention when using:
- Carefully review executed commands
- Recommend running important tasks in a sandbox environment
- Regularly backup important data

## 🔗 Extended Features

### 🐍 Python Library Interface
AGI Agent now supports being called directly as a Python library in code, providing a programming interface similar to the OpenAI Chat API.

**📖 [View Python Library Usage Guide →](md/README_python_lib.md)**

- 🐍 Pure Python interface, no command line needed
- 💬 OpenAI-style API, easy to integrate
- 🔧 Programmatic configuration, flexible control
- 📊 Detailed return information and status

### 🤖 Custom Agent Toolset

The system supports flexible customization of the tools available to the Agent:

- By default, the system loads tools defined in `prompts/tool_prompts.json`
- To enable additional tools, move the corresponding entries from `prompts/additional_tools.json` into `prompts/tool_prompts.json`
- To disable tools you don't need, move them from `prompts/tool_prompts.json` back to `prompts/additional_tools.json`, reducing the Agent's tool count and lowering token consumption

### 📝 Custom Prompts

All system prompts can be freely edited and customized. The prompt files are located in the `prompts/` directory:

| File | Description | Effective Mode |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `prompts/system_prompts.txt` | Main system prompt | Agent mode |
| `prompts/rules_prompt.txt` | Tool-calling rules prompt | Agent mode |
| `prompts/user_rules.txt` | Additional user requirement prompt | Agent mode |
| `prompts/system_plan_prompt.txt` | Plan mode system prompt | Plan mode |

In Agent mode, the system loads `system_prompts.txt`, `rules_prompt.txt`, and `user_rules.txt`. In Plan mode, `system_plan_prompt.txt` is loaded instead. You can directly edit these files to adjust the Agent's behavior and style.

### 🔌 MCP Protocol Support
